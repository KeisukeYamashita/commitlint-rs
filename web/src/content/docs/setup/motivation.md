Why commitlint in Rust?

It's very simple, we wanted to complete it in the Rust ecosystem ðŸš€

It is hard to prepare a `package.json` for a Rust project to use an existing commitlint, or to prepare a Node.js runtime with CI.
Therefore, we have re-implemented a commitlint that can be easily used with cargo install, etc.
