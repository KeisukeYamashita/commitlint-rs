## Using `cargo` CLI

Commitlint is written in Rust so you can install it using `cargo` CLI:

```console
cargo install commitlint-rs
```

After that, you will be able to run the `commitlint` command.

```console
commitlint --help
```

## Using Docker

Commitlint is also available as a Docker image.
You can pull it from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/1915keke/commitlint).
